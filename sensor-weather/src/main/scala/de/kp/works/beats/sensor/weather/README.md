# Weather Beat

The current implementation of this *Beat* supports the OpenWeather API and also the German Weather Service (DWD).
DWD datasets, MOSMIX station data, are used to forecast weather conditions for the next 10 days, including global
horizontal irradiance (GHI).

GHI is one of the critical weather parameters that are required for predicting the power generation of PV systems.
